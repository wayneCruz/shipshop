  comment: "These turned out to fit pretty well so I bought 2 colors. They are nice enough to be business casual and wear to work, but comfortable and not dressy so they can work in a casual fit. Only had them about 2 weeks so can't comment on longevity. Only minor issue I've noticed, which seems to be affecting clothes anywhere now - even if you buy the same size just in different colors the sizing will be slightly off. The darker brown color fits a little loose while the light khaki fits more snug. No shrinking in the wash they just came like that. So be mindful it's a little inconsistent"
